The reading paints a very optimistic picture of the future of AI. I do believe that ASI and AGI are possible but I think it will take longer than couple of decades. The AI we have today and are developing today use mathematical computation to come up with a solution. However, the decision making process of humans is far from mathematical computation.  We experience emotions and are not always rational. If you want a machine that can act like humans beings in the true sense than going after computation power may not be the right approach. Yes, with increased computation power, we could have a machine that can do similar things to what human beings can do but it will remain a machine. I strongly believe that future of AI lies not in the computational complexity of a machine but in the understanding of the human brain. 

Regarding Paperclips, it was very confusing at first. But, as I started to get the hang of it, I got addicted to the game. I spent almost three hours playing it. Itâ€™s really makes you feel the exponential growth. You are trying to increase your revenue from 100 to 200 dollars and within the next 5 minutes you will be trying to increase the revenue from 1000-2000 dollars.
